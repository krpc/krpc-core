# kRPC TestServer

This program can be used to run a kRPC server without needing to launch the
game. It's intended purpose is for automated testing of kRPC clients.

## Usage

To run, execute "TestServer.exe" from a command line.
Run "TestServer.exe --help" for more information on configuring the server.

Note:
 * The version of KRPC.dll in this archive will not work with KSP. It is
   only intended for use with TestServer outside of the game.
 * The Mono DLLs included are from Mono 4.5 - they are not the
   same as those used by KSP.
